            <p class="description-meCard">I am Shane D. Wilson, a Grammy award winning recording and mixing engineer
                who, after 27 years has reached the end of his usefulness in the world of music making.
                <br>
                I noticed that all of the kids who were leaving the music business were pivoting to code.
                <br>
                I want to be a cool kid.
                <br>
                Iâ€™m pursuing a new career in coding.

                As a child of the '70's, I have no choice but to make him my favorite dinosaur. He was the favorite of
                me and all of my friends.
